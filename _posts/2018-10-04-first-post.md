This is a first test post. I plan to use this blog to post about topics that I am studying in political science. The page is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I use Markdown to author my posts.

Test writing with latex: $int_{x}^1f(x)dx$ for inline test.
Test2: writing with latex: \(int_{x}^1f(x)dx\) for inline test.


And centered text writing:

$$y =3x+4$$

Test 2:
\[y =3x+4\]


Did it work?

 {% raw %}
  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping! 
 {% endraw %}
